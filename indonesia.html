          <p>Landing in Jakarta, my first experience of Indonesia was that of a bustling metropolis. We spent a day visiting the National Museum, wandering around street markets, and trying out local street food from numerous vendors. We quickly decided to leave the city and made our way to the south of Java with plans to hike Mount Bromo, an active volcano that last erupted in 2016.</p>

          <p>Watching the sunrise against a breathtaking landscape of Bromo, with fuming volcano peaks slowly rising above the sea of clouds, was a once-in-a-lifetime experience and well worth the early start.</p>

          <p>Next, we made a quick stop in Bali with the intention of planning our further journey from there. We were able to relax, visit famous surfing spots, and experience the unique culture of Bali. We spontaneously booked a flight to Sumba Island, which is one hour by air from Bali and can only be accessed from there. We did not know anything about that island prior to our visit, but what a gem of a discovery it was!</p>

          <p>Sumba is a large island in the east of the Indonesian archipelago and remains fairly unknown to foreign travellers, except for more adventurous surfers who go there in search of some of the world’s best waves. We spent our time exploring the island’s remote beaches, traditional villages, and ventured into a wild jungle to find the most amazing waterfalls. Not to mention, for all of that time, we felt like the only tourists on the island and met with incredible friendliness and hospitality from the locals. It is important to mention that Sumba has its own distinct culture that revolves around local tribal beliefs, a religion called Marapu, with its own traditions and customs. We were able to experience some of it when visiting numerous traditional villages with abundant peaked houses that are to be seen everywhere on the island. It was truly a highlight of the trip and proof that sometimes the best plan is no plan.</p>

          <p>After making our way back to Jakarta, we took an overnight trip to the Thousand Islands archipelago. Only an hour away from the biggest city in Indonesia, there is a cluster of islands that can easily be mistaken for the white sand paradise of the Maldives. It was a great way to finish our trip by relaxing on a tiny island, surrounded by crystal clear, azure ocean, where we spent a day snorkelling around the reefs and eating freshly prepared seafood. Soon it was time to hop back on the boat to Jakarta and get ready for a flight to London.</p>

          <p>Indonesia presented itself as an extremely diverse and beautiful country that has something for all types of travellers, and with so much more to discover, I will definitely be back. Actually, I am already planning my next trip.</p>
