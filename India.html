          <p>My trip started in New Delhi, and as soon as I exited the airport, I was welcomed by the bustling atmosphere of the Indian capital. The intensity of the city was unlike anything I had ever experienced before, even compared to London. Although we didn't plan to stay in Delhi for long, we spent a day exploring the city before boarding an overnight train to Varanasi.</p>

          <p>Varanasi, also known as Banaras, is one of the oldest continuously inhabited human settlements in the world and is the holiest city for Hindus. As a cultural and spiritual capital of India, we listened to traditional Indian music and witnessed the ancient tradition of cremation and pilgrims bathing in the Ganges. A sunset cruise on the Ganges offered us a stunning view of the ghats, and we left Varanasi feeling like we had experienced something truly unique and special.</p>

          <p>After a couple of days in Varanasi, we headed south to Kochi, the old colonial fort city and capital of Kerala. The city boasts remnants of Portuguese, Dutch, and British rule, and the atmosphere was noticeably more relaxed and tropical. We rented scooters and explored the palm-lined beaches of Kerala before venturing to the backwaters, a unique canal system that we explored on a houseboat.</p>

          <p>We also took a long scooter ride to the mountains north of Kochi, where we found ourselves in Munnar, also known as "God's Own Country" for its picturesque rolling hills lined with tea plantations. The journey to Munnar was quite the experience, with a six-hour ride through some of the craziest traffic imaginable and winding roads in the mountains. However, it was all worth it once we arrived and were greeted with breathtaking views. It is easily one of the most photogenic places I have ever visited and we spent days just exploring the area and taking in the views. Although we hoped to see wild elephants, we had no such luck.</p>

          <p>Overall, India was an incredible destination that I will visit again. It's perfect for seasoned travelers who enjoy venturing off the beaten path and experiencing unique cultures and customs.</p>
