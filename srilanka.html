            <p>My trip to Sri Lanka was a dream come true. Unfortunately I only had a couple days planned in this country before continuing my journey and I decided to head south and relax in one of the beach destinations. I started in the beach town of Weligama, where I spent most of my time learning to surf. The waves were perfect for beginners, and the instructors were patient and friendly. I couldn't believe how quickly I progressed and how much fun I had.</p>

            <p>In my typical habit, I couldn't stay in one location for too long and I spent most of my time in Sri Lanka driving a scooter along the coast, discovering numerous beaches. Each one was more beautiful than the last, with crystal-clear water and soft, white sand. But my favorite beach was Harikatya, where I spent an entire day surfing and relaxing. The waves were perfect, and the beach was quiet and secluded, with only a few other surfers in the water.</p>

            <p>When I wasn't surfing or relaxing on the beach, I explored the nearby towns and villages. I visited Galle, a historic Dutch fort city with charming streets lined with colorful buildings and cafes. I also went to Mirissa, a small fishing village with a laid-back vibe and stunning views of the ocean. The people in Southern Sri Lanka were incredibly welcoming and friendly, and I felt right at home.</p>

            <p>The beaches, the people, and the culture were all amazing, and I know I will return. If you're looking for a tropical paradise with great surfing, beautiful scenery, and friendly locals, I highly recommend a visit to Southern Sri Lanka and I will definetely come back to discover other parts of this beautiful country.</p>
