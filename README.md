# Hobby Page

Hobby Page created by Oskar Przybylski as part of an application process for Founders and Coders.

This is a hobby page for showcasing Oskar's recent travels to South East Asia.
The website contains a home page that gives a brief overview of the contents and allows visitor to select one of the three destinations. Header element contains a subheading that includes the current date.

Destination pages give a brief overview of the destination and paragraphs telling a story of the travels. Each destination also showcases travel photos from each place in a grid pattern.

## Planning

Before writing any code I have made notes what elements the website should include and a brief description of content.
Next I have made a rough sketch of planned layout to present the intended content.

Before starting to build a website I have familiarised myself with the key principles behind html, css and DOM.

## Building

I have started by creating a box layout for each website element based on my sketch, starting with the home page.
Once happy with the general layout, I have started filling in containers with content such as headings, placeholder paragraph text and images.
Eventually I have also added a script that presents current date, formatted it and included in a header element to fit in as part of a paragraph.

Whenever I got stuck on how to create certain layout or element, I used online resources, tutorials and stackoverflow for reference.

Next, I worked on formatting the page using css stylesheet. I have adjusted colour palette, added borders and adjusted size of various elements as well as adjusted text formatting and used a custom font to make page more engaging and aesthetically pleasing.

Next, I have created the destination pages based on the layout of the home page, but adapted as required and added a photo grid.

Once I was happy with general layout and formatting I have worked on content, added final paragraph text and images with relevant alt text.

## Debugging

I have checked website functionalities and layout to determine if they work as expected. I have tried different screen sizes, zoom in and out and tried different browsers to see how it behaves and made adjustments accordingly. Whenever I could not determine the source of the issue I referred to online tutorials and stackoverflow. Eventually tested the website once deployed with GitHub Pages and fixed any final bugs.
